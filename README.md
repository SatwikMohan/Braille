Mobile Application in MobileApp Branch

Machine Learning model for writing purposes (trained on pre-available dataset)

PROBLEM STATEMENT

With the use of efficient software and hardware we will allow a blind person to read and write using a phone screen. For normal users they can even convert their own text to braille format for printing purposes using an efficient website.


Objective

As we know that use of mobile phones has made the life easier. Making a prototype by which a blind person can interact with a smart phone by implementing Mobile Application, Machine Learning, Web Application and Hardware. A Blind person can read using The Braille Script on a paper but with the help of the prototype the blind will be able to read and write Braille using a smart phone exposing them to various opportunities around the world.
